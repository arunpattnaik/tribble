<p class="question" style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Q:</b> Why is the image size restricted?</p>
<p class="answer" style="margin: 0 0 24px 0; font-size: 16px;"><b>A:</b> Storage is expensive. By imposing size restrictions we try to encourage people to give focus to smaller details that make their work shine, rather than posting whole layouts while keeping storage costs to a minimum.</p>
